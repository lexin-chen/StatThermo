# StatThermo: Unlocking insights with statistical thermodynamics - one algorithm at a time
I have created a customized Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm written in Python that can sample the Boltzmann distribution across a variety of functions and temperatures. By plotting the potential energy functions, calculating probability distributions, and computing averages, this algorithm enables a detailed analysis of the system under study. 

In addition, I have a scripts that
