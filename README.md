### Unlocking insights with statistical thermodynamics - one algorithm at a time
This repo contains statistical thermodynamics algorithms. Most are from my statistical thermodynamics course (CHM6461). 

I have created a customized Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm written in Python that can sample the Boltzmann distribution across a variety of functions and temperatures. By plotting the potential energy functions, calculating probability distributions, and computing averages, this algorithm enables a detailed analysis of the system under study. 

In addition, I have a scripts that 
- Calculate value of $\pi$ using a Monte Carlo.
- compared stirling's approximation with actual value.
